# CS 5001 Final Project Instructions

For your final in CS 5001, we would like you to present a project related to the content learned in 5001. 
Term projects provide tangible benefits to your learning, and to your own personal goals and interests. 
It gives you as a student the opportunity to demonstrate what you learned in an applied manner. 

Your final deliverable for the project will have multiple components

1. A presentation, including a slides, demo, and code walk, (~ 10 minutes). 
   * For in-person students, this will be during a class session, with the possibility of being recorded
   * For online only students, this will be a video submitted by the deadline. 
2. A GitHub repository containing all code and files related to the project.
3. A final retrospective/reflection. 
4. A meeting one-on-one with an Instructor or TA for project approval. 

Due dates will be listed in canvas, along with the full rubric. 

## Project Selection

When selecting your project, you will have two phases. The first involves evaluating options, doing some background
research, and then presenting your project idea to a Instructor or TA in a one-on-one meeting. The 
meeting can happen during office hours or at another arranged time. 

1. When selecting your project, think smaller! The most common mistake with projects is selecting something too large
   * The purpose of the meeting is to:
     * Make sure your ideal is more realistic in the limited time frame
     * Meets requirements to highlight topics you learned in CS 5001
  

Here are some [project ideas](ProjectIdeas.md). Look through them, but don't feel limited by them! There are many possible options for projects, and these are just a few ideas. 

## Deliverable Details

### Presentation
Your presentation should have about 5 slides 
* Goals and Rationale
* Tools and Methods (Highlight a few key concepts in your code)
* Findings/Lessons Learned (What was hard/easy?)
* Limitations and Future Extensions
* Citations/references/URLs for key resources you relied upon

* **Demonstrate Your Code**: You should also demonstrate your code as part of the presentation. 

* Explain 1-2 key concepts in your code, such as a key function line by line (called a "code walk")
* Highlight how your approach meets some of the **big ideas** of CS 5001 (e.g., divide-and-
conquer, recursion, mutability, exceptions, data types (such as dictionaries), objects)


### Github Repo
You will create a github repository to host your code, and share a link to that repo. The repo should include
a README.md explaining what the project is (and class it is for), and highlights some key aspects of the project. You will
create this under your personal github account (you can create one if you don't have one, the free version is fine). The reason
we are asking for the github hosting is (1) your project is something you should demonstrate to the world - though you are free to make it private after we grade it, and (2) you will use github in future courses, so this helps prepare you in advance. 

For your code, we will be looking at:

* Code organization: Is it well organized? Is it easy to navigate? It should not be a single giant main function!
* Code quality: Is it readable? Is it well documented? Is it well commented?
  * You should have a docstring comment for **every** function, and for standard comment for **every** line of code that is not obvious.
* Code style: Is it consistent? Does it follow the [PEP8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)?
* Test Cases: Did you test your code to ensure validity? Have you created a documented process to repeat that testing?


#### Principles of Good Design, Documentation, Testing and Style:
* Top-of-File triple-double documentation string consistent with style guidelines
taught during this semester 
* Top-of-Function/Method triple-double documentation string consistent with style
guidelines taught during this semester 
* Modular design using functions, objects, and methods, with each function or
method doing one job. No “giant main()” ugly coding
* Validation of all user input. Error-handling evident throughout
* Thoughtful design choices around scope, aliasing, and mutability
* Little or no duplication of code
* Extensible: organized to allow increased functionality in the future
* Test code is provided and indicates thorough coverage



### Final Retrospective/Reflection
You will write a short reflection on your project. This should be a few paragraphs, and should include:
* The main learning points for the project
* What you liked about the project
* What you struggled with the most
* What you can work on in the future
* Relate the project to your future goals as a programmer.

As a reminder, reflections should *NOT* be bullet points answering the questions, but instead written in prose paragraphs.



### Grading Rubric
Will be posted in Canvas. Submission will on canvas. 



### Resources for Github
* [Getting Started with Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account)
* [Git Handbook](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git)
* [Markdown / Writing on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github)

While the resources talk about git on your computer, and it is something you should explore - you can simply upload all your files to your repo once you create it via the web-interface.
